# NoNutNovember
Whenever you open an app, it will pop up a notification that is customizable (meaning you can change the title and you can change the message of the notification). The tweak also uses app list so you can choose which apps you want the notification to pop up in. You might think why this would be useful at all. This tweak can be a constant reminder to do something. So for an example whenever you enter that app you choose, there can be a notification to tell you to put your phone down and do your homework or tell you to go to the mall. Another use can be to prank your friends :)
